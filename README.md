# 🧠 Spoko – AI-Driven Speech Therapy

## 💡 Inspiration

Some individuals with speech disorders—caused by conditions such as stroke, cerebral palsy, or autism—face significant challenges in accessing reliable therapy services. With **Spoko**, I set out to build a personalized, AI-powered solution that removes geographic and financial barriers, making speech therapy accessible to anyone, anywhere.

## 🚀 What It Does

**Spoko** is a web-based application designed to support users with speech impairments through:

* 🗣️ **Tailored speech exercises** to target specific challenges
* ⏱️ **Real-time feedback** via integrated voice recognition
* 📊 **Progress tracking** to monitor improvement in fluency, articulation, and pronunciation
* 🎮 **Gamified experiences** to enhance engagement and consistency

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* 💻 **Frontend:** Vite + React
* 🧰 **Backend:** Node.js + MongoDB
* 🤖 **AI & Voice Recognition:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text + Cloudflare AI

## 🧩 Challenges I Faced

Integrating real-time voice recognition into a browser-based app required extensive fine-tuning of AI models and latency optimization. Handling speech data accurately, securely, and responsively was one of the most complex aspects of development.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project deepened my experience in:

* 🔍 Applying **speech recognition technologies** to real-world challenges
* 🛡️ Building **secure, full-stack web applications** from the ground up
* 🎯 Designing with **accessibility and inclusivity** as core priorities

## 🔐 Cybersecurity

Inspired by platforms like 1Password, I implemented robust data protection features, including:

* 🗄️ Encrypted storage of usernames and passwords in MongoDB
* 🌍 IP address tracking to detect suspicious login activity
* 🤖 reCAPTCHA for bot prevention and spam filtering
* 🔐 Backend authentication built with best practices for user security

## 🌍 Accessibility-Focused Design

Accessibility was a central focus of Spoko’s development. After extensive research on the needs of people with speech impairments—including children and elderly users—I tailored the design to support usability and clarity:

* 🎨 High-contrast, readable color schemes
* 🔤 Clear, legible typography optimized for all ages
* 🧩 Intuitive and inclusive games designed for therapeutic support
  These features also serve individuals practicing public speaking or working through speech-related anxiety.
